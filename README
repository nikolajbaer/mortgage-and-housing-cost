This program was written as an alternative to the spreadsheet my fiance was working on because:

1. I dislike spreadsheets (they hide formulas and show data, i prefer code, which shows formulas and hides data).
2. I wanted to follow through with the same calculation processes
3. We realized we just don't fully understand what it takes to own a home.

I am making this available in the hopes that some people i will know might help make it more accurate, and maybe someone else will find it useful.

There are alot of mortgage type calculators out there in javascript and everything else, but I like python, and I am trying to make this one focus on how much it costs, to make sure I can afford the payments even with changing job situations.
